###Notes
- Use `npm init` to create a package.json file. Think of this like Bundler in Sinatra/Rails.
- Install express with `npm install -- save express`. The `--save` flag will write code in your package.json file to grab any dependencies for express.

- Install socket.io with `npm install socket.io`

- Install nodemon globally with `npm install -g nodemon`. This acts as a restarter for your express server. Use the command `nodemon server.js` to start up the server.
